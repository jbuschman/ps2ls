= DME =

`DME` files contain model mesh data.

== Format ==

`DME` files are binary files written in big-endian byte order.

{{{
typedef unsigned char byte_t;

struct vector3_t
{
    float x;
    float y;
    float z;
};

struct aabb_t
{
    vector3_t min;
    vector3_t max;
};
}}}

=== DMOD ===
The first block in the file is the `DMOD` block.

{{{
struct dmod_t
{
    char magic[4];
    unsigned int version;
    unsigned int dmat_length;
};
}}}

`magic` is a 4-character code that is always `"DMOD"`.

`version` defines the version of the `DME` file.  At the time of this writing, the only values encountered have been `3` and `4`.

`dmat_length` defines the length of the `DMAT` block.

----
=== DMAT ===
Immediately following the `DMOD` block is the `DMAT` block, which has information about the materials used for this model.

{{{
struct dmat_t
{
    char magic[4];
    unsigned int version;
    unsigned int length;
    char* materials;
};
}}}

`magic` is a 4-character code that is always `"DMAT"`.

`version` defines the version of the `DMAT` block.  At the time of this writing, the only value encountered has been `1`.

`length` defines the length in bytes of `dmat_t::materials`.

`materials` is a contiguous block of null-terminated strings of size `dmat_t::length`.
----
=== UNKNOWN0 ===
Immediately following the `DMAT` block is a block of unknown data we will call `UNKNOWN0`.

{{{
struct unknown0_t
{
    unsigned int version;
    unsigned int unknown_1;
    unsigned int length;
};
}}}

`version` defines the version of the `UNKNOWN0` block.  At the time of this writing, the only value encountered has been `1`.

`length` defines the length in bytes of the `UNKNOWN0` block relative to the start of the `UNKNOWN0` block.
----
=== MODEL ===
The `MODEL` block begins at the absolute file offset defined by `dmod_t::model_header_offset`.
{{{
struct model_t
{
    char unknown_0[12];
    aabb_t aabb;
    unsigned int mesh_count;
};
}}}

`aabb` defines an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_bounding_box#Axis-aligned_minimum_bounding_box axis-aligned bounding box] that encompasses the model.

`mesh_count` is the number of `MESH` blocks that immediately follow the `MODEL` block.

----
=== MESH ===
Immediately following the `MODEL` block, there are `model_t::mesh_count`  `MESH` entries.

The structure of the `MESH` block is dependent on the value of `dmod_t::version`.

==== Header ====

The first part of the `MESH` block is the header.  The structure of the header differs depending on the value of `dmod_t::version`.

===== Version 3 ======

{{{
// use when dmod_t::version is 3
struct mesh_t
{
    byte_t unknown_0[16];
    unsigned int bytes_per_vertex;
    unsigned int vertex_count;
    unsigned int unknown_1;
    unsigned int index_count;
};
}}}

===== Version 4 =====

{{{
// use when dmod_t::version is 4
struct mesh_t
{
    byte_t unknown_0[16];
    unsigned int vertex_block_count;
    unsigned int unknown_1;
    unsigned int index_count;
    unsigned int vertex_count;
};
}}}

`vertex_block_count` defines the number of vertex data blocks in this mesh.  When `dmod_t::version` is `3`, this value is assumed to be `1`.

`index_count` defines the number of indices in this mesh.

`vertex_count` defines the number of vertices in this mesh.

==== Vertex Block(s) ====

Immediately following the header are `mesh_t::vertex_block_count` vertex blocks.

{{{
struct vertex_block_t
{
    unsigned int bytes_per_vertex;
    byte_t* vertices;
};
}}}

`bytes_per_vertex` defines the number of bytes per vertex for the vertex block.

`vertices` is a contiguous block of vertex data.  The length in bytes of this block is `mesh_t::bytes_per_vertex * mesh_t::vertex_count`.  In the first vertex block, the first 12 bytes for each vertex define a `vector3_t` struct defining its location.

==== Index Block ====

Immediately following the vertex block(s) is the index block.

{{{
unsigned short* indices;
}}}

`indices` is a block of contiguous indices of length `mesh_t::index_count * sizeof(unsigned short)` that index into the vertex array.  Each sequential set of 3 indices define a triangle of the mesh in a clockwise winding order.
----
==UNKNOWN1==
Immediately following the `MESH` entries, there is a block of unknown data of a variable length we will call `UNKNOWN1`.
